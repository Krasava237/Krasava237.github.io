                My autobiography includes the wonderful years in kindergarten,
                where I was first introduced to friendship, play and learning.
                This period of my life has left unforgettable memories in my
                heart.

              <p>
                Time at school was a new stage of my life. I was immersed in a
                world of knowledge, friendship and self-discovery. Lessons,
                sports, evening activities - all this inspired me to new
                achievements and shaped my personality. School became the
                foundation for my future.

                University has opened up new horizons of knowledge and
                opportunities for me. I immersed myself in the study of my
                specialty, made precious friendships and broadened my horizons.
                University years became a time of self-determination and
                preparation for my future career.

                Now I am already a student of elbrus bootcamp. I have passed the
                technical interview and started the distant learning in phase 0.
                I have a lot of challenges and discoveries in front of me, but I
                think it is worth it.
